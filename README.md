# Frontend Project Name

## Overview

This is the frontend application for the shopMaster. It is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project locally, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v20.10.0 or later)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (comes with Node.js)

## Project Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend-repo-name.git

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd frontend-repo-name

2. Install Dependencies
Once you're in the project directory, install all the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install

This command will read the package.json file and install all the required libraries and packages needed to run the project.

3. Configure Environment Variables
If your project relies on environment variables (e.g., API URLs), create a .env file in the root of your project. You can base it on a sample .env.example file if provided. For example:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

4. Run the Application
After setting up the environment variables, you can start the application with:
```bash
npm start

5. Build for Production
If you want to create an optimized production build, use the following command:
```bash
npm run build

This will generate a build/ directory with the production build files, which can be deployed to your hosting platform.
